# Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning 🌸

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an **end-to-end Machine Learning workflow** for classifying iris flowers into three species:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica  

It was developed as part of an AIML certification project (Week 1–3 tasks).

## 🚀 Workflow
### Week 1
- Selected the **Iris dataset**.
- Defined problem statement.
- Prepared dataset for ML.

### Week 2
- Selected **RandomForestClassifier** as the ML model.
- Implemented training and testing.
- Evaluated performance using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.

### Week 3
- Simulated **deployment** by making predictions on new data.
- Created final submission files (`.ipynb` and PPT).
- GitHub link added in the Solution slide of the presentation.

## 📊 Results
- Accuracy: ~96–100%
- Model: RandomForestClassifier
- Confusion Matrix generated and saved as `fig_confusion_matrix.png`
